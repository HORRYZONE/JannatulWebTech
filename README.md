FoodHunting web project

# Project Description

We have chosen food and beverage as the theme for our project. Our group has
decided to launch a foods and beverages searching organization specifically for this
undertaking. A nonprofit group called Food Hunt was founded to assist consumers in
finding popular food stands and establishments in Malaysia. With features like search
filters, we aim to provide the users with an effective and worthwhile food-hunting
experience. In relation to Sustainable Goal Development, Goal 8: Decent Work and
Economic Growth, we believe that the Food Hunt project is in line with target 8.3
primarily in promoting decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation,
and encouraging the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized
enterprises.

Our website consists of five main pages which are home, about us, donate, food hunt
and help. We have chosen three main fonts which are Poppins, open sans and league
spartan. The whole concept for this website is minimalist yet fresh and straight to the
point for easy navigation for all users. The background colour is creamy white and the
elements used are colourized with colours like orange, black, white, and green for an
extra pop of colour.

We have a donation form for our website. In relation to Sustainable Goal
Development, Goal 1: No Poverty and Goal 2: Zero Hunger, the people can willingly
donate money to our non-profit organization where 70% of the earnings are used to
provide food for the needy whilst the latter will be donated to a charity of our choice.
With that in mind, we manage our donation by allowing the users to donate as much as
they want. They just need to enter their details and amounts to proceed with the
donation.

Our website also provides a food hunt page which can be used to search for viral
restaurants or stalls in Malaysia. In addition, people can minimize their search for viral
foods or beverages by searching near the area. Moreover, people can filter their hunt for
food restaurants according to the restaurant type to their liking so it will not be a hassle
for them to choose. From that, they can review the details regarding the stalls or
restaurants of their search so that they can know what kind of food or beverage they
want.
